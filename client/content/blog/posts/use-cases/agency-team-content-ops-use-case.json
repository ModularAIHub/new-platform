They fail because approvals, context switching, and scheduling handoffs create daily bottlenecks.\n\n## A Practical Team Workflow\n\n### Stage 1: Strategy and Prompt Setup\n- Set audience and positioning in Strategy Builder\n- Create reusable prompt sets by client niche\n\n### Stage 2: Batch Generation\n- Generate a controlled content batch\n- Split drafts by campaign and funnel stage\n\n### Stage 3: Internal Review\n- Reviewer checks message clarity and brand fit\n- Team lead approves final queue\n\n### Stage 4: Scheduling Execution\n- Assign platform-specific timing for Twitter and LinkedIn\n- Keep a 14-day operating window for flexibility\n\n### Stage 5: Weekly Performance Review\n- Keep what performs\n- Rewrite what underperforms\n- Update prompt templates with observed winners\n\n## Why This Model Scales\n- Lower coordination overhead\n- Fewer accidental posts\n- Faster turnaround for client campaigns\n\n## Best Fit\n- Agencies managing multiple clients\n- Small teams that need predictable publishing velocity\n",
