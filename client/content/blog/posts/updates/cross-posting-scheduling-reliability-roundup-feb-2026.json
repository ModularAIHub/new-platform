  "excerpt": "A major reliability-focused update across Tweet Genie, LinkedIn Genie, and Social Genie: better cross-posting parity, timezone-safe schedules, stronger session persistence, and clearer analytics tracking.",
  "content": "## Quick Answer\n\nWe shipped a reliability-heavy cross-platform update that makes SuiteGenie more consistent across X, LinkedIn, and Threads, especially for scheduling, mirrored cross-post visibility, and analytics tracking.\n\n## What Improved (High Impact)\n\n### 1. Cross-Posting Schedule Visibility Across Apps\n- Scheduled cross-posts now appear more consistently in target apps as read-only mirrored rows\n- Ownership remains clear with labels like `Managed in Tweet Genie` or `Managed in LinkedIn Genie`\n- Teams can verify planned posts without duplicating schedule management\n\n### 2. Timezone Consistency for Mirrored Scheduled Posts\n- Fixed schedule time mismatches caused by timezone parsing differences between apps\n- Mirrored rows now display the correct scheduled time with timezone labels (for example `Asia/Kolkata`)\n- This reduces one of the most confusing issues in cross-platform scheduling workflows\n\n### 3. Better Cross-Posting Coverage in Social Genie (Threads)\n- Threads scheduling and cross-post visibility received multiple fixes so users can track what is scheduled and what is managed externally\n- Meta/Threads compose flow now exposes cross-post controls in the right places for real publishing workflows\n\n### 4. Analytics Now Reflects More Scheduled and Cross-Posted Content\n- Analytics tracking improved for scheduled and externally created posts\n- Recent-post sections help users confirm that content they scheduled or cross-posted is actually being tracked\n- This is especially useful for validating team workflows and cross-platform publishing\n\n### 5. Session and Authentication Reliability Improvements\n- Session expiry and token refresh handling was tightened so users are less likely to get logged out unexpectedly during active use\n- This matters for bulk scheduling and scheduled publishing reliability across longer windows\n\n## Team Workflow Progress (Practical, Not Heavy)\n\nWe also started improving team cross-posting with a more controlled approach:\n- explicit target account selection (instead of ambiguous defaults)\n- safer account routing behavior for team publishing\n- stronger attribution for analytics and history\n\nThis makes it easier to support real scenarios like posting from one team member's X account to another team member's LinkedIn account without introducing confusing automation rules.\n\n## Quality of Life Fixes Included\n- cleaner scheduler status text rendering in UI\n- improved dev environment behavior for connection checks (Vite proxy/base URL consistency)\n- more predictable scheduling lead-time behavior in Tweet Genie\n- credits and monthly reset behavior aligned more clearly with plan logic\n\n## Why This Release Matters\n\nMost social media tools talk about multi-platform posting. The hard part is making it reliable when teams, scheduling, analytics, and account ownership all interact.\n\nThis update focused on that execution layer: fewer hidden mismatches, clearer visibility, and better confidence when you are shipping content at scale.\n\n## What This Means for Agencies, Teams, and Creators\n- More trustworthy cross-platform scheduling views\n- Better analytics confidence after scheduled or cross-posted publishing\n- Fewer interruptions caused by session/auth edge cases\n- Cleaner multi-account workflows as team routing support expands\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe are continuing to improve team cross-post routing (account-to-account targeting) and expanding reporting/retention features for long-term content operations.\n\nIf you are running a multi-platform calendar, this release should feel meaningfully more stable in day-to-day use.",
