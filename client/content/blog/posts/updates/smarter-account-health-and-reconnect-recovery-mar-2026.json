  "content": "## Quick Answer\n\nWe improved the way SuiteGenie evaluates account health so users see fewer misleading reconnect prompts and get clearer feedback about whether an account is actually ready to post.\n\n## What Improved\n\n### 1. Better Account Readiness Checks\n- account health is evaluated more carefully before showing a reconnect warning\n- posting-capable accounts are less likely to be marked unusable too early\n- status messaging is more aligned with what the user can actually do next\n\n### 2. Clearer Media vs Posting Status\n- media-specific limitations are easier to distinguish from full posting issues\n- users can better understand whether the problem is a general connection issue or a media capability issue\n- teams working with multiple accounts get cleaner signals during publishing\n\n### 3. Better Recovery for Active Workflows\n- active publishing flows now do a better job of staying focused on whether the account is truly usable\n- this reduces interruption during day-to-day work, especially in multi-account environments\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nMost creators and teams do not want to think about account state until something goes wrong. The best experience is not just showing more warnings. It is showing the right warning only when it truly matters.\n\nThat is why this update matters:\n- less unnecessary friction before publishing\n- better trust in the posting flow\n- cleaner distinction between connection status and capability status\n\n## Best Outcome for Users\n- fewer misleading reconnect prompts\n- better clarity when a specific action needs attention\n- more confidence while publishing across multiple accounts\n\n## What This Means for Teams\n\nTeam workflows become much easier when account health is predictable. This update supports that by reducing avoidable confusion around which accounts are truly ready to publish.\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\nReliable publishing starts with reliable account health. This update makes SuiteGenie more practical for real creators and teams by focusing on accuracy, not noise.",
