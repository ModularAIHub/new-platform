  "content": "## The Starting Point\n\nThe original challenge was not writing content. It was keeping quality and consistency while managing multiple channels every day.\n\n## What Broke Repeatedly\n- Random content ideas without strategy context\n- Long scheduling queues that aged badly\n- Team handoffs with unclear ownership\n- Analytics checks that happened too late\n\n## Product Decisions We Made\n\n### Strategy Before Drafts\nWe built Strategy Builder first in the workflow so generation starts with context, not noise.\n\n### Short Planning Windows\nWe push teams toward practical planning windows and regular iteration instead of massive static queues.\n\n### Approval and Team Safety\nWe built team-aware context and approvals to protect publishing quality.\n\n### Data Hygiene by Default\nWe introduced cleaner deletion and retention behavior so history remains useful without becoming cluttered forever.\n\n## The Philosophy\n\nAutomation should improve judgment, not replace it. SuiteGenie is designed as a system for better decisions at higher speed.\n",
