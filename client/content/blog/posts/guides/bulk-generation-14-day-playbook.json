  "content": "## Why 14 Days Works Better\n\nLong-range bulk plans often break because trends shift, priorities change, and quality drops. A 14-day cycle keeps plans fresh while still saving time.\n\n## Step 1: Start with One Strategy Theme\n- Pick one core campaign objective\n- Define 3 to 5 content angles\n- Keep language and CTA style consistent\n\n## Step 2: Generate a Focused Batch\n- Generate a practical set of prompts, not endless drafts\n- Remove weak drafts immediately\n- Keep only posts that match audience intent\n\n## Step 3: Build a Balanced 14-Day Mix\n- Educational posts\n- Story-led posts\n- Proof and outcomes posts\n- Conversion-oriented posts\n\n## Step 4: Schedule for Twitter and LinkedIn Separately\n- Use platform-specific tone and length\n- Keep posting windows consistent per platform\n- Avoid duplicating the same copy everywhere\n\n## Step 5: Review Mid-Cycle\n- Check engagement and response quality after 7 days\n- Replace weak posts for week two\n- Feed winning patterns back into prompt inputs\n\n## Operating Guardrails\n- Keep queue size manageable\n- Avoid over-automating without review\n- Prefer predictable cadence over random bursts\n\n## Result\n\nYou get strong content velocity with lower operational risk and better learning loops.\n",
