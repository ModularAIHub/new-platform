  "content": "## Why Bulk Planning Works\n\nMost founders and small teams do not need a giant content machine. They need a repeatable way to create enough high-quality content without losing control.\n\n## The Best Operating Window\n\nA practical planning window is:\n- 7 days if you move fast and iterate often\n- 14 days if you want more breathing room\n\nThat keeps the system flexible without letting content go stale.\n\n## A Simple SuiteGenie Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Start With Strategy\nUse Strategy Builder to define:\n- audience\n- positioning\n- key themes\n- repeatable post angles\n\n### Step 2: Generate in Batches\nUse bulk generation to create multiple drafts in one focused session.\n\nGood target:\n- 10 to 20 strong drafts\n\n### Step 3: Cut Hard\nDo not schedule everything just because it exists.\n\nKeep the best:\n- strongest hooks\n- clearest ideas\n- most on-brand angles\n\n### Step 4: Schedule the Best Window\nUse your strongest posts to fill the next 7 to 14 days.\n\n### Step 5: Review and Repeat\nOnce the first batch starts publishing:\n- review what got attention\n- improve the next prompt set\n- replace weaker angles fast\n\n## Why This Works Better Than Endless Drafting\n- less context switching\n- cleaner review flow\n- easier scheduling discipline\n- better feedback loop into future prompts\n\n## Best Fit\n- founders running personal brand plus product marketing\n- small teams managing a shared publishing calendar\n- agencies building predictable content ops for lean clients\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\nBulk generation works best when it is connected to strategy and scheduling. Generate enough to create momentum, schedule only what is strong, and use analytics to sharpen the next batch.",
