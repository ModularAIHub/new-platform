  "content": "## What You Will Set Up\n\nBy the end of this guide, you will have:\n\n- A repeatable weekly Twitter workflow\n- A topic pipeline for consistent posting\n- A scheduling rhythm tied to audience behavior\n- A simple QA system before posts go live\n\n## Step 1: Connect Your Account and Define Posting Goals\n\nStart by connecting your Twitter/X account in SuiteGenie settings. Then define your weekly objective:\n\n- awareness\n- lead generation\n- community engagement\n\nPick one primary goal so automation supports outcomes, not just activity.\n\n## Step 2: Build a Prompt Bank for Consistent Angles\n\nCreate 10-15 prompts around your content pillars. Keep prompts specific:\n\n```txt\nCreate 3 short posts for startup founders about reducing manual social media work.\nTone: clear, practical, non-hype.\nInclude one concrete action in each post.\n```\n\nUse templates for repeatable content types like threads, hooks, and quick tips.\n\n## Step 3: Generate and Batch Content Weekly\n\nGenerate posts in batches once per week. Work in this order:\n\n1. Generate draft set\n2. Trim weak posts\n3. Rewrite top performers for different angles\n\nBatching reduces context switching and saves significant time every week.\n\n## Step 4: Schedule by Time Block, Not Randomly\n\nUse fixed scheduling blocks tied to your audience windows. Example:\n\n- Tuesday 10:30 AM\n- Wednesday 6:00 PM\n- Friday 11:00 AM\n\nConsistency outperforms random publishing for most accounts.\n\n## Step 5: Review Metrics and Feed Learnings Back\n\nEvery 7 days, check:\n\n- impressions\n- engagement rate\n- replies/bookmarks\n\nPromote winning themes into next week's prompt bank and retire low-signal topics.\n\n## Recommended Weekly Checklist\n\n- [ ] Refresh prompt bank with current themes\n- [ ] Generate 20-30 drafts\n- [ ] Approve top 8-12 posts\n- [ ] Schedule across 5-7 days\n- [ ] Review metrics and iterate\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Over-automating with zero review\nAI drafts should be edited before publishing. Keep human QA in the loop.\n\n### Posting high volume without strategy\nMore posts do not help if messaging is unclear.\n\n### Ignoring replies\nAutomation should create more time for engagement, not replace it.\n",
