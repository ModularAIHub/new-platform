  "content": "## Quick Summary\n\nMeta Genie is our next rollout, and it is designed to unify Threads, Instagram, and YouTube execution in one practical workspace.\n\n## Why Meta Genie Exists\n\nRight now, teams still jump between tools for planning, writing, approvals, scheduling, and tracking performance across Meta platforms and YouTube. That fragmentation slows output and lowers quality.\n\nMeta Genie is being built to fix that with one connected operating flow for Threads, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\n## What You Can Expect in the First Rollout\n\nInitial focus areas:\n- Unified publishing workflow across Threads, Instagram, and YouTube\n- Shared calendar and execution visibility\n- Better approval and collaboration flow for teams\n- Cleaner tracking of what is drafted, approved, and published\n\n## Rollout Plan\n\nWe are taking a staged release approach to keep quality high.\n\n- Stage 1: Internal hardening and controlled production checks\n- Stage 2: Early access for selected active users (Threads invite-only while app is under review)\n- Stage 3: Broader release once reliability targets are met\n\n## Platform Status\n\n- **Threads**: Complete but invite-only while the app is under Meta review\n- **Instagram & YouTube**: In production and ready for use\n\n## Who Should Care Most\n\n- Agencies handling multiple client pipelines across Meta platforms and YouTube\n- Creators running consistent weekly publishing systems\n- Teams that want one place for planning and execution across these platforms\n\n## What Happens Next\n\nAs we get closer to release, we will publish:\n- Early access criteria\n- Detailed feature walkthroughs\n- Migration guidance for existing workflows\n\nMeta Genie is close, and we are focused on shipping it right, not rushing it out.",
