  "content": "## Quick Answer\n\nWe improved team routing in SuiteGenie so account selection behaves more predictably during team-mode publishing and cross-posting workflows.\n\n## What Improved\n\n### 1. Better Team Context Handling\n- team publishing is more likely to stay in the intended team scope\n- shared-account workflows are less likely to drift into the wrong account context\n- multi-account teams get more consistent behavior while switching between accounts\n\n### 2. More Predictable Source and Target Selection\n- the selected source account and destination target account are easier to reason about\n- team workflows now feel more intentional instead of relying on hidden defaults\n- this is especially important when multiple people and multiple accounts are involved\n\n### 3. Better Trust for Team Publishing\n- teams can move faster when they do not need to second-guess which account is about to be used\n- cleaner routing means cleaner history, scheduling, and analytics confidence later\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe moment a social tool supports multiple accounts, team roles, and cross-posting, routing becomes the real product challenge. A small account-context mistake can create a big operational headache.\n\nThat is why this update matters:\n- safer collaboration\n- better confidence before publishing\n- better consistency across apps\n\n## Who Benefits Most\n- agencies managing multiple client accounts\n- startup teams with owners, admins, and editors\n- creators managing both personal and shared brand accounts\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\nGood social software is not just about making it possible to post. It is about making it clear which account is posting, in which scope, and why. This update is a step toward that kind of operational trust.",
