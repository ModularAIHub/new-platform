  "content": "## Quick Summary\n\nSocial Genie is our next rollout, and it is designed to unify multi-platform social execution in one practical workspace.\n\n## Why Social Genie Exists\n\nRight now, teams still jump between tools for planning, writing, approvals, scheduling, and tracking performance. That fragmentation slows output and lowers quality.\n\nSocial Genie is being built to fix that with one connected operating flow.\n\n## What You Can Expect in the First Rollout\n\nInitial focus areas:\n- Unified publishing workflow across channels\n- Shared calendar and execution visibility\n- Better approval and collaboration flow for teams\n- Cleaner tracking of what is drafted, approved, and published\n\n## Rollout Plan\n\nWe are taking a staged release approach to keep quality high.\n\n- Stage 1: Internal hardening and controlled production checks\n- Stage 2: Early access for selected active users\n- Stage 3: Broader release once reliability targets are met\n\n## Who Should Care Most\n\n- Agencies handling multiple client pipelines\n- Creators running consistent weekly publishing systems\n- Teams that want one place for planning and execution\n\n## What Happens Next\n\nAs we get closer to release, we will publish:\n- Early access criteria\n- Detailed feature walkthroughs\n- Migration guidance for existing workflows\n\nSocial Genie is close, and we are focused on shipping it right, not rushing it out.",
