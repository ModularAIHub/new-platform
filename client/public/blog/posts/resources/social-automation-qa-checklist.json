Without review checkpoints, teams scale mistakes instead of outcomes.\n\n## Pre-Publish QA Checklist\n\n### Message and Positioning\n- Is the core point clear in the first two lines?\n- Does this match the intended audience and funnel stage?\n- Is the call to action specific?\n\n### Platform Fit\n- Is this phrasing optimized for Twitter or LinkedIn?\n- Is post length practical for the platform?\n- Are hashtags relevant and minimal?\n\n### Brand and Risk\n- Is tone aligned with brand voice?\n- Any overclaims or vague statements?\n- Any compliance-sensitive language to review?\n\n### Scheduling Quality\n- Is this in the right time slot?\n- Does this collide with another similar post?\n- Is this still relevant for the scheduled day?\n\n### Performance Loop\n- What metric defines success for this post?\n- Is this tied to a current campaign objective?\n- How will this inform next-week prompts?\n\n## Operating Recommendation\n\nUse this checklist during batch review and again 24 hours before scheduled publication.\n",
