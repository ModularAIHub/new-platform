Choose built-in keys if you want faster setup with less technical overhead.\n\n## Comparison\n\n### BYOK\n- Better cost governance\n- Direct control over provider and model choices\n- Good fit for advanced teams and agencies\n\n### Built-In Keys\n- Faster onboarding\n- Fewer setup steps for non-technical users\n- Good fit for teams prioritizing speed to launch\n\n## What Matters Most in Practice\n- Your team technical comfort\n- Monthly usage variability\n- Need for provider-level optimization\n- Internal governance requirements\n\n## Recommended Decision Rule\n\nIf your team publishes heavily and tracks costs closely, start with BYOK.\nIf your team needs immediate execution and simplicity, start with built-in keys and revisit later.\n",
